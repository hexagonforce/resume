	abstract = {Software-defined networking is an emerging technology for implementing Quality of Service ({QoS}) for its logically centralized control and decoupled control and forwarding planes. In this paper, we extend a previous framework that simulated a fat-tree topology software defined network under {QoS} provisioning techniques to support different topologies, including data from the Internet Topology Zoo. We compare round-trip times between each server and client, and transfer rates of {HTTP} traffic in the tree, mesh, and topology provided by Kreonet and Uni-C under a distributed class-based queuing system. We observe that while round-trip times are not significantly different, transfer rate of {HTTP} traffic as generated by {ApacheBenchmark} in Kreonet decreased 57.1109\% from the fat-tree topology, and 49.5328\% from the mesh topology. Uni-C topology took 114.9\% more time for the switches in the network to have installed all their flows than the Kreonet topology, the next slowest topology. Uni-C topology also failed to finish the {HTTP} benchmarks due to its more complex topology in a resource-limited machine. These differences demonstrate that the complexity of real world network environments (i.e. route loops, layering, convergence times) affect the network behavior, which is key to a good simulator. Therefore, the modified framework is able to support and properly simulate real-world network topologies.},
