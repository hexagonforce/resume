    I want to be in jobs that can help the community go through the daily life or help disadvantaged communities have more accessibility to technology. I will work for companies that work in accessibility or open-source software. Later in my career, I plan to shift to a more assistive role, for which I have two options: a sign-language translator, or a train driver for the subways of Korea.
